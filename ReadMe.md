## AI Blogging Agent 🚀

Welcome to AI Blogging Agent - a weekend project that turned into something kinda cool! This is a smart writing assistant that can generate entire blog posts based on a topic and any context files you provide.

# 🧐 What's This All About?

Staring at a blank screen, struggling to come up with blog content? Same here. So, I built this AI-powered blogging assistant to handle the heavy lifting. It's powered by Gemini (Google's AI), but with a few tweaks, you can hook it up to any LLM of your choice.

This agent doesn't just spit out generic text - it actually:

✅ Creates a proper structured outline

✅ Writes engaging introductions and conclusions

✅ Generates detailed sections with headings

✅ Analyzes PDFs and code files you upload

✅ Provides content improvement recommendations

# 💡 Why Use This?

If you just need a quick blog post, ChatGPT is probably fine. But this tool offers more:

🔥 Agentic workflow - Thinks through the whole blog structure📄 Processes your code files & PDFs - Generates more relevant content🎨 Sleek Gradio interface - Easy to use and visually appealing🔓 Open-source - Tinker and customize however you want

With the right model setup, this could be your secret weapon for churning out those LinkedIn posts that look human-written (but totally aren’t).

# 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the Repo:

git clone https://github.com/srinath-96/Blogging-Assistant.git

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Your Gemini API Key:

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

Fire It Up:

python -m app.gradio_interface

Start blogging like a boss! 💪

# 🛠 What's Under the Hood?

This project leverages:

LangGraph - For structured, multi-step AI workflows

Gemini API - For high-quality text generation

Gradio - For an interactive user-friendly interface

Everything is modular, so you can swap out components and experiment with different models or frontends.

# 🚧 Limitations & Future Ideas

🔹 Sometimes the AI goes off on weird tangents (relatable, right?)🔹 More templates for different blog styles could be added🔹 A "Publish to WordPress" button might be cool🔹 AI-generated blog header images would be a nice touch

# 🎉 Final Thoughts

This is the first of many "vibe-coded" projects I’m putting on GitHub. Is it perfect? Nope. Is it useful? Maybe! Will it make you look like a prolific content creator? Absolutely.
